# simple-japanese-minecraft
A minecraft resource pack that makes learning japanese easier by imersion

## Why?
English is my second language. I learned some vocabulary by playing minecraft and wanted to do the same with Japanese. Then the problem occured. I don't know kanjis, and most blocks/items use them. I searched online for some time to check if someone made something like this resource pack, but surprisingly NO! The only solution I got is to make it myself. And here we are!

## How it works?
- All the settings, world options, commands etc. are in English
- Every thing in-game is in Japanese

### Why not everything in Japanese?
The answer is simple. There is no space for it. I will make other versions of it in the future, but for now I stay with only in-game names to be Japansese.

### How it looks?
I made to be as simple as I can to proper reading. What it means? Japanese language is known to not use spaces in their sentences, so I splitted it into parts like in this example:
```
"錆止めされた酸化した切り込み入りの銅の階段" is turned into "sabidome sareta sanka shita kiri komīri no dō no kaidan"
```

## Plans for future updates
I plan to update this pack with new things, but only when full version of minecraft is realesed. I WILL NOT update it for snapshots, because items and blocks names could be changed. Also I want to make similar language pack with the names not romanized but with kana characters.

## Errors in transcriptions or missing text
Please use github issues to make a ticket for missing text or error. Idealy send a screenshot of missing text and write an english item name/id. Same for error/mistakes but also please send correct version of the spelling.
